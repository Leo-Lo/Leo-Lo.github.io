I am a fourth year physics PhD student at the Condensed Matter Theory group at Harvard University, working with Professor Ashvin Vishwanath. I am broadly interested in quantum information and quantum phases of matters (especially topological order).

When I am not doing physics (which is becoming increasingly rare!), I like rock climbing, playing the flute, coming up with random melodies, and biking. And here is a [random rock](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/tools/sbdb_lookup.html#/?sstr=leolo) in our solar system.
