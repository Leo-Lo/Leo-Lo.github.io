I am a fourth year physics PhD student in the [Condensed Matter Theory group](https://avishwanath.scholars.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University, working with Professor [Ashvin Vishwanath](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/vishwanath). I am broadly interested in quantum information and quantum phases of matters (especially topological order). Previously, I also studied topological superconductivity and provided theory support for near-field optical microscopy experiments.

When I am not doing physics (which is becoming increasingly rare!), I like rock climbing, playing the flute, coming up with random melodies, and running. And here is a [random rock](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/tools/sbdb_lookup.html#/?sstr=leolo) in our solar system.
